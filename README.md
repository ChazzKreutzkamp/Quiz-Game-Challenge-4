# Coding Quiz Challenge!

This application is a simple coding quiz that presents ten questions for the user to answer via four answer options.
If the user answers a question correctly their score goes up by one. However, the quiz is timed, and the user only
has 65 seconds to answer all ten questions, and if they answer a question incorrectly their score decreases by ten
seconds. After the user runs out of time or answers all the questions they will then be presented with an option
to see their score and submit it, or play again. If they choose to submit their score, it will then be appended
to a list of high scores that can be accessed at any time.
